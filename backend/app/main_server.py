`Picar-X Racer` is a project aimed at controlling the [Picar-X vehicle](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/stable/) using a modern web interface inspired by racing video games.

This server runs in a separate process from the car-controlling server to ensure that control operations are never blocked.

It provides endpoints for:

- video streaming including AI object detection with YOLO and video enhancements,
- music/sound playback,
- managing settings and files,
- serving the frontend,
- reading battery status from ADC.
